# Password Strength Checker

## Description
This project checks the strength of a user-provided password based on length, character variety, and entropy.

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Weak passwords are one of the most common causes of security breaches. This project demonstrates how password strength can be evaluated to reduce the risk of brute-force and credential-based attacks.

## Features
- Minimum length check
- Uppercase and lowercase character detection
- Numeric and symbol detection
- Password strength rating

## Technologies Used
- Python

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Enter a password when prompted.

## Ethical Considerations
This project is for educational purposes only and does not store or transmit passwords.

## What I learned
- How password policies reduce brute-force attack success
- How to validate user input securely
- Why length alone is not sufficient for password strength
- How to structure Python code using functions

## Possible Improvements
- Entropy-based scoring instead of rule counting
- Password hashing simulation (bcrypt)
- GUI or web interface
