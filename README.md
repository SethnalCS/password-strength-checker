# Password Strength Checker

## Description
This project checks the strength of a user-provided password based on length, character variety, and entropy.

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Weak passwords are one of the most common causes of security breaches. This project demonstrates how password strength can be evaluated to reduce the risk of brute-force and credential-based attacks.

## Features
- Minimum length check
- Uppercase and lowercase character detection
- Numeric and symbol detection
- Password strength rating

## Technologies Used
- Python

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Enter a password when prompted.

## Ethical Considerations
This project is for educational purposes only and does not store or transmit passwords.
