# Password Security Notes

Weak passwords significantly reduce the time required for brute force and credential stuffing attacks.

Modern Systems should:
- Enforce minimum password complexity
- Rate limit login attempts
- Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g bcrypt)
This project demonstrates only password evaluation not storage
